<h1>Our first view ðŸš€</h1>
<p>In this page you can find the most important and interesting books who really helped me to be passionate about the journey I am in and how to get the most out of it! Each of these books taught me somehow the attitude and commitment you might have to pursue what you really want. Probably most of you know them but Iâ€™ve tried to summarize from my standpoint!
Worth a look!

<h3>IKIGAI</h3>
<h4>The Japanese secret to a long and Happy Life</h4>
<p>Each of us is driven by a purpose, you just have to discover it. Ikigai, a Japanese way of life, incorporates this concept: figure out what you are good at, what you enjoy and, finally, how you can create value from these two passions. Furthermore, donâ€™t forget to take care of your body and focus on what really matters in your life. By doing this, your life will become easier in every aspect. Regardless of all the problems you face, remember to take action and set a threshold of activities to do so that you don't feel lonely. I think it is good to get out of your comfort bubble and discover yourself by taking some risks, otherwise you will always remain within the confines of your own circle. Have experiences, immerse yourself in other cultures, learn, ask, and don't be shy about making mistakes, despite all the problems you will face. Step out of your comfort zone and find your inner self and what you really want to do with your life, whether it is a job or a holiday. Find what makes you feel good, hang out with friends who would like to see you achieve your goals.
But remember that the most important thing is to plan your day with commitment, when you decide in your mind to do that, do it! Be flexible, there are two different beliefs: there are people who think that concentrating on developing a single skill and immersing yourself to the maximum on it is better than learning many different skills but at a lower level.
It's up to you which one you want to step in!

<h3>THE NUDGE</h3>
<h4>Think differently!</h4>
<p>The book is a milestone in the field of marketing. It depicts the opportunities that can be achieved by using simple, small details in any kind of marketing communication. How can a simple detail drastically change the vision and feeling? Even if it seems unreal, it is the key to holding the attention of the beholder! In recent years, several private companies as well as public organizations have tried to use this type of tool to highlight elements that keep the audience's attention. Has it been worth the effort? Statistically, it has been proven that by adopting these small measures, the public has changed their minds by a large percentage.  Once again, communication plays a crucial role in shaping the emotions of the audience. The book emphasizes the fact that sometimes we want to be influenced by others to take the right path, otherwise we might get lost in unnecessary time wasting evaluating what is best for us. Make a decision you are most passionate about and whatever comes up with the program, stick with it. Whether it is worthwhile or not, you will still learn more than you knew before. The more you know, the more you are worth!
