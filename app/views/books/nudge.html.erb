<h3>THE NUDGE</h3>
<h4>Think differently!</h4>
<p>The book is a milestone in the field of marketing. It depicts the opportunities that can be achieved by using simple, small details in any kind of marketing communication. How can a simple detail drastically change the vision and feeling? Even if it seems unreal, it is the key to holding the attention of the beholder! In recent years, several private companies as well as public organizations have tried to use this type of tool to highlight elements that keep the audience's attention. Has it been worth the effort? Statistically, it has been proven that by adopting these small measures, the public has changed their minds by a large percentage.  Once again, communication plays a crucial role in shaping the emotions of the audience. The book emphasizes the fact that sometimes we want to be influenced by others to take the right path, otherwise we might get lost in unnecessary time wasting evaluating what is best for us. Make a decision you are most passionate about and whatever comes up with the program, stick with it. Whether it is worthwhile or not, you will still learn more than you knew before. The more you know, the more you are worth!
