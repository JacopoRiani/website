    This was a project implemented in PowerBI whose objective was to find the gap between the available Headbox venues and the customers' demands in terms of locations and events. Whether it was a personal event or a corporate meeting, the aim was to match all the different requests with the perfect venue and event. The data was retrieved from the platform's database. I used several charts, each of which is interconnected. This allowed us to better understand the demand for different parameters.
